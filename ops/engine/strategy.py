# Market Council house strategy (version 1, PAPER). It borrows concepts that hedge funds use and
# keeps only the ones a small long-only account can run: equal risk across asset classes, a trend
# rule, a volatility cap, and a seven-point scorecard for single shares. This file back-tests the
# rules, works out what the strategy would hold today and writes state/strategy.json. It places no
# orders and does not change the decision cards; it runs on paper until Ben says otherwise.
